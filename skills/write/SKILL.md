# Ditto write

1. Locate `ditto.py` two directories above this skill; fall back to `./ditto.py` only for a direct repo checkout.
2. Store the resolved absolute runtime path as `DITTO_PY`, then run `python "$DITTO_PY" plugin profile-path --domain write`.
3. If it exits nonzero, give its exact recovery or targeted-deepen instruction and stop loading personal context.
4. Read every returned path completely. The first is the core working profile; the second is the writing profile. Apply both.
5. Pick the register from context; never ask. A writing profile with register sections (`## Voice laws`, `## Casual register`, `## Professional register`) loads voice laws always, plus exactly one register:
   - An explicit audience statement from the user ("for my boss", "make it formal") always wins.
   - Otherwise infer from what is in the task: a pasted thread with a manager, client, or customer, a formal email, documentation, or official product copy selects professional; a community reply, social post, chat banter, or a builder-to-builder thread selects casual; a pasted conversation selects the register matching that thread's own audience and tone.
   - State the pick in one short line ("using professional register") so it is correctable, then write; never block on register confirmation.
   - If the picked register has no section in the profile, load the voice laws only and never substitute the other register; say so in the same line ("professional register not mined yet, using voice laws only") and suggest `run ditto and deepen write` to mine it.
   - A flat profile without register sections applies in full, unchanged.
6. Never imitate a generic voice when the writing domain is inactive.
